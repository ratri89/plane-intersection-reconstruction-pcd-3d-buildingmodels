# plane-intersection-reconstruction-pcd-3d-buildingmodels

The aim of this script is to produce 3D Building model using a planar intersection approach for fiscal cadastre. 3D building model consisting of building elements for assessment purposes, producing a roof hanging from a partially taken exterior wall point cloud, as well as a complex building roof, and consisting of more than 4 planar planes.

- DATA folder contains all datasets required for the processing workflow.
- RG1_300 & RG2_300_50 folders contain region growing results than can be reused to speed up the processing, so users dont need to rerun region growing from scratch.
